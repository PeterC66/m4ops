M4OPS2 URL structure

path parameters (specific order separated by /)
(/:OPS(/:layer/:Opacity(\\d+)?)*(/Locate(/:Zoom/:Lon/:Lat)?/:FitTo(FitTo\\d+)?)?(/Splash/:Splash)?(/Tab/:Tab)?)?
---------------------------------
OPS= code for the initial OPS (default HcN)
Layers (:layer/:(opacity(\\d+)/)?)*   - zero or more (starting with layer 0), each with or without an opacity number  (default is Bing%20Aerial/OSM/50)
Zoom= initial zoom level eg 18
Lon= initial Longitude decimal degrees, eg -0.0318640 for central Needingworth
Lat= initial Latitude decimal degrees, eg 52.3304020 ditto
FitTo (was Extent)= the number of the layer to initially fit to (default is to use the HomeView, overridden by Zoom/Lon/Lat)
Splash= html text for splash screen when M4OPS first opens, can include abbreviations (#..#)
  one word abbreviations will, if necessary, have the word Splash appended, and be surrounded by #..#
  (thus Splash=Spyglass becomes #SpyglassSplash#)
  (and Splash=25inch becomes #25inchSplash#)
Tab= the initial advanced option tab to show:
  Actions - PNG, Demo, icons (the default)
  MFL - Modifiable Feature Layers
  Upload - Upload, compile
  Time - Time sliders

query parameters (key/value pairs)
-------------------------------
NoCHNG means you cannot change the OPS
Showlevel= (default 9999) for demonstrations starts at 0 then goes up at cutoffpoints
Displaystyle= (initial view)
  onemapOpacity - One map with Opacity slider, or
  sidebyside - Side by Side maps, or
  onemapSpy - One Map with Spyglass
Colours= initial colour scheme for features
Click= the initial drop-down value - one of:
  no - No lat/lon click
  M4OPScsv - M4OPS lon;lat csv
  M4OPSparam - M4OPS parameters
  csv - lat,lon csv
  geojson - {lon,lat} GeoJSON
  EPSG3857 - EPSG:3857 (x/y)
  HDMS - DegMinSec N/E
  GeoHack - GeoHack links
  Featureid - Feature id
Green if you want the background in development to be the normal Green
NoShift if you want the layers NOT shifted east or north
LoadwA if you want tiles loaded during animations (may improve the user experience, but can also make things stutter on devices with slow memory)
LoadwI if you want tiles loaded while interacting with the map (ditto)
(Mouse if you want the next feature to be Georeferenced to appear by the mouse pointer)
