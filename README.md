# m4ops

Mapping for One-Place Studies

A refactoring of the prototype [M4OPS](http://mapping4ops.org/M4OPS?Splash=Default), in light of experience.

*Under development.*

Note that I start trying to do this in React and Redux, but switched in early October 2018 to Vue.js and Vuex.
There are still lots of React remnants that need to be Vue-ified.
