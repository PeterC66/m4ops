# To Do

## Top Priority

- Production version

## Issues to be resolved

- layerAndSourceTile: (tileserver) const OPSCode = 'HcN'; // Kludge TODO
- after OPS choice close box
- implementing loading aspects
- maps created asynchronously with promises
- disallow duplicates in OPS.json titles (FLG.php)
- don't allow already chosen layerDefs in new ChooseLayer, to avoid duplicate key error
- Zoom:Center as was
- Allow Rotation:
- window size to screen
- simplify Continents production FLG etc?
- "No layers" selected message
